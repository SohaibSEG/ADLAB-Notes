# ADLAB-Notes

As I delved deeper into Hack The Box machines, I realized that I was struggling in Windows environments, particularly with Active Directory.

But instead of giving up, I decided to take matters into my own hands and embark on a mini-project to master AD!

To better understand how components interact with each other I've created an Active Directory lab that has a Domain Controller and a single computer using VMware. Because I believe I can learn more quickly and efficiently by actively engaging in hands-on practice.

But that's not all! In the future, I plan to make the lab vulnerable to various AD misconfigurations, so I can practice AD penetration testing within it, and to take things even further, I might even add more computers and deploy different services like SQL server and a webserver running IIS.
